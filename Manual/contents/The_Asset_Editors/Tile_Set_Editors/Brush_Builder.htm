  <h1>The Tile Set Brush Builder</h1>
  <p>By default when you &quot;paint&quot; tiles onto a <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="tile map" href="#">tile map</a> layer in the room editor, you select a single tile and paint with that. However, tile sets are almost always designed to have sections
    that fit together in different ways to form whole areas or items. For example, an RPG tile set may have landscape feature tiles that can be connected to create larger or smaller features - like trees and buildings - depending on the number of tiles
    used. Now, placing multiple features like this on a room layer would require you to go back and forth many times to change tile, which is not good for your workflow. To resolve this, <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> enables you to create tile <strong>Brushes </strong>in
    the Tile Set editor, available when you click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on the <strong>Brush Builder</strong> button:</p>
  <p><img alt="Brushes" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Tilesets_Brushes.png"/>In the <strong>Brush Builder</strong> you have the original tile set on the left and a blank &quot;canvas&quot; on the right. You can now select
    any tile from the left and paint it on the right to create custom &quot;brushes&quot; which you can then use in the room editor. Note that you can click and hold the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> then drag on the tile set to select multiple tiles to paint into the brush canvas and you can also hold down <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> to add specific individual tiles or hold down <img alt="Alt Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Alt.png" width="55"/> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> to remove specific tiles.</p>
  <p>The following image shows our previously mentioned landscape features as an example of three custom brushes made from a single tile set:</p>
  <p><img alt="Features As Brushes Example" class="center" height="534" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Tilesets_FeaturesBrushes.png" width="940"/>On the right you can see three features that we&#39;ve made (highlighted with an orange box
    in the image). Notice how we&#39;ve left a gap of one tile between each feature - this is because <em>any touching group of tiles will be treated as a single brush</em> in the room editor, so we leave a gap of one tile to show that each set is a distinct
    brush we want to create. While creating your brushes, you paint with the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> and delete with the right mouse button <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21"/>. You can also zoom the tile sheet or the brush canvas using <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> and the mouse wheel <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png" width="21"/> when the mouse
    is over one of the windows, or you can pan around using <img alt="Space Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Space.png" width="55"/> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> or
    the middle mouse button <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png" width="21"/> and dragging. Note that you can also use the zoom tools in the <strong>Toolbox</strong> within the editor windows to change
    the zoom levels of either window as well as toggle the grid visibility and colour.</p>
  <p>At the top right you can see the currently selected tool, and you can also set the size of the brush that you want to paint with. The default size is 1, which is a single tile, but if you set it to higher values then you can paint (and erase) with a
    larger brush composed of the selected tile repeated, as shown in the image below:</p>
  <p><img alt="Tile Size Animation" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Tilesets_Tile_Size.gif"/>The toolbox is where you can select the tool to use for many different tasks in the Tile Set editor, some of which will depend on whether
    you have anything defined in your <a href="Auto_Tiles.htm">auto tile</a> library. A brief outline of each tool is given below (note that when you have selected a tile layer in the Room Editor, then this toolbox is displayed at the top of the room
    workspace, along with additional drawing tools):</p>

        <td class="text">This is the pencil tool. It uses the selected tile to paint in the Brushes window with the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> and you can erase with the right mouse button <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21"/>.</td>

          the reserved &quot;empty&quot; tile.</td>

        <td class="text">This is the selection tool, which can be used to define an area of the Brushes window for working on. You can click the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> and then drag the mouse

To clear the whole selection you can press <img alt="Escape Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Escape.png" width="55"/>.

  <p>Below the tools, you can find two different sections for selecting any <a href="Auto_Tiles.htm"><strong>auto tile</strong></a> or <a href="Animated_Tiles.htm"><strong>animated</strong> tiles</a> that have been created using the current tile set image.
    A single sprite that is used for a tile set can have many, many, single cell images in it, and these can be combined in the Animation or Autotile editor to create custom brushes which will show up in these sections and can be used in conjunction with
    regular static tiles to create brushes (note that an animated tile will animate regardless of whether you have selected it from the library or from the base tile set).</p>
  <p>Once you have set up all the brushes you require, you can then use them to paint tiles onto any tile map layer within the <a href="../Rooms.htm">Room Editor</a>.</p>
